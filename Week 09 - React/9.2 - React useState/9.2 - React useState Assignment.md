# **Week 09 - 9.2 | React useState**


## Assignment #1 - Counter Application
Create a simple counter application that increments and decrements a number when buttons are clicked. The counter value should persist in local storage, so that when the page is refreshed, the counter value remains the same.

## Assignment #2 - Fetching User Data
Build a component that fetches and displays user data from a public API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder). When the component mounts, it should fetch the data and display it. The component should also handle loading and error states.
